# restaurant_guide_in_Puerto_Rico

Welcome to my project 2 for Data Analytics

The purpose of this project is to be able to showcase some skills that I have learned but at the same time start the foundation for project 3.

What is the purpose?

I want to create an interactive map of Puerto Rico where you would be able to see and select different types of restaurants and create data and see data of the different types of restaurants in the island.

I will be selecting a max of 5 counties or (pueblos) out of the 78 that are in PR. I would also like to implement web scrapping and api data to see if we can find a trend of types of restaurants that have open during the year and what type of restaurants would you see more often. 

What are the basic requirments of this project:

1.Create an interactive web site with dashboards (one or more pages) that either tells a story with data or provides a rich experience for allowing users to interact with data. Your project should meet the following requirements at minimum:

2.Include a Python Flaskâ€“powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one cloud database (MySQL or Postgres on AWS or MongoDB on MongoDB Atlas)

3.Work with a data set that contains at least 500 records

4.Contain database and web site integration through Flask where data manipulations are done using Python and/or JavaScript prior to visualization

5.Utilize Plotly and/or Leaflet to create one or more web dashboards with interactive, dynamic, filterable web visualizations and/or maps and include at least three views of the data

6.Include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes)

7.Be deployed to Heroku and should be fully functional on any machine at any location

Things that I want to also implement on this project if time permits:

1.Include one JavaScript library that we did not cover

2.Deploying a bot that does automated data operations and updates a cloud database (nightly or multiple times per day)

3.Incorporate web scraping into your project

4.More robust UX requirements


How will I gather the data:

I will be using google API for the current data and web scrapping to see if there is news of closing and opening of restaurants and or goverment official sites that have the information of when a restaurants has open and or closed.

I want to also see what types of restaurants have been able to survive the natural disasters and economic pressures that the island have faced since Hurracane Maria.

How will this data be used for project 3 you ask? Well if you end up in the team i will tell you or you will have to wait and see when I present it =)

The 5 cities that i will work with are:
1. San Juan
2. Ponce
3. Rincon
4. Fajardo
5. Arecibo

Types of restaurants we will be looking at:
1. Spanish 
2. puertorican
3. middle eastern
4. chinese
5. fast food
6. bar restaurant
