We created a search based user experience that also gives them a bit of a Historical facts about the island of Puerto Rico and helps them plan where they would like to eat. 
Out of the 78 possible "Pueblos" (Cities) only 5-7 where selected with higher population or higher turist visit to help us gather data faster. Using Google API withing the Cities that where selected and type of restaurants that researched gathered to be in higher demand by search. Gave the opportunity to create a solid starter sample that will give the entrepreneurs a higher chance to formulate their business plan with a higher percentage of success.
The Next step for this project is to create a phone application that will help groups of friends or significant other choose where to eat. This is in the works of getting created past class.
