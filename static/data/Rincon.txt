Rincón is a town on Puerto Rico’s west coast, known for its beaches. Punta Higuero Lighthouse 
overlooks Domes Beach, with its pounding surf. Central Sandy Beach is lively. Steps Beach is the 
site of Tres Palmas Marine Reserve, home to parrotfish and hawksbill turtles. South along the coast 
are quiet Caribbean beaches like Corcega. Offshore, coral reefs surround tiny Desecheo Island. ― Google
